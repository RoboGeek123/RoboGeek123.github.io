# What is misec?

Misec is a Michigan based IT/ Infosec community inclusive to all experience levels.  If you're looking to get involved in information security, or are currently involved, I would *highly* recommend getting involved in misec.  I attended my first misec meetup in June of 2018, and since then I've research, created, and given a talk at the local Southfield chapter.  Whether, you're looking to better your knowledge of IT/infosec, or just expand your network, I can't recommend getting involved enough

# History
[Misec](https://www.misec.us/) launched with BSides Detroit 2011. We started with a simple idea: make the BSides experience an ongoing part of life in Southeastern Michigan. This expanded into monthly meet-ups, workshops, capture the flag teams, and more. We continue to put on the BSides Detroit conference, and to send speakers and volunteers to conferences around the region.
