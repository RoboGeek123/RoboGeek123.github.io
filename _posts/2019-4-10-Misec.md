misec launched with BSides Detroit 2011. We started with a simple idea: make the BSides experience an ongoing part of life in Southeastern Michigan. This expanded into monthly meet-ups, workshops, capture the flag teams, and more. We continue to put on the BSides Detroit conference, and to send speakers and volunteers to conferences around the region.
