# The Idea

Since I started playing guitar years ago, I've always loved tinkering with electronics and building my own equipment.  I've always wanted to tinker with a large multi-effects pedal board similar to Axe Effects or the Line 6 Helix.  However, these boards are often very expensive.  What if we could build our own based around a Raspberry Pi 3.
